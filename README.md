This repository contains my second task from the Wells Fargo Software Engineering Virtual Work Simulation Project on the Forage online application. In this project, I assumed the role and responsibilities of a project analyst, with a primary focus on designing a data model to enhance the efficiency of financial advisors in managing their clients' portfolios. The two main tasks were:

Implementing the Data Model with Java: I translated the data model into Java classes within Visual Studio Code. I created classes for each entity, annotated them with @Entity, ensured the auto-generation of primary keys, added constructors to initialize instance variables, and provided getter and setter methods for the attributes.
